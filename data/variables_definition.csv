"Variable","Definition"
"Fund Performance variables",
"Net Internal Rate of Return (IRR)","The net IRR, obtained from Preqin, uses the present sum of cash contribution, the present value of distributions and the current value of unrealised investments and applies a discount. The amount excludes any carry or performance fees earned by the GP."
"Net Multiple","The net multiple, obtained from Preqin, represents the sum of total LP distributions and the unrealised value of the fund, divided by the total LP contributions (expressed as a multiple)."
"Public Market Equivalent (PME)","PME are calculated as in Kaplan and Schoar (2005). PME is the discounted present value of fund distributions plus any remaining residual value by the present discounted value of capital calls. Discount rates are calculated based on the return of the S&P 500 or the MSCI ACWI."
